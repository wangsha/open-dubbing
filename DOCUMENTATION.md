# How it works

The system follows these steps:

1. Isolate the speech from background noise, music, and other non-speech elements in the audio.
2. Segment the audio in fragments where there is voice and identify the speakers (speaker diarization).
3. Identify the gender of the speakers.
4. Transcribe the speech (STT) into text using OpenAI Whisper.
5. Translate the text from source language (e.g. English) to target language (e.g. Catalan).
6. Synthesize speech using a Text to Speech System (TTS) using voices that match the gender and adjusting speed.
7. The final dubbed video is then assembled, combining the synthetic audio with the original video footage, including any background sounds or music that were isolated earlier.

There are 6 different AI models applied during the dubbing process.

# Speech to text (SST)

For speech to text we use OpenAI Whisper. We provide two implementations:

* HuggingFace transformer's
* faster-whisper

faster-whisper works on Linux and it is a better implementation. HuggingFace transformer works in mac OS and Linux.

It is possible to add support for new Speech to text engines by extending the class _SpeechToText_

# TTS (text to speech)

Currently the system supports the following TTS systems:

- MMS: Meta Multilingual Speech engine, supports many languages
  - Pros
    - Supports over 1000 languages
  - Cons
    - Does not allow to select the voice (not possible to have male and female voices)
* Coqui TTS
  - Pros
    - Possibility to add new languages
  - Cons
    - Many languages only support a single voice (not possible to have male and female voices)
* Microsoft Edge TSS server based
  - Pros
    - Good quality for the languages supported
  - Cons
    - This is a closed source option only for benchmarking
* CLI TTS
  * Allows you to use any TTS that can be called from the command line
* api TTS
  * Allows you to use any TTS that implements an API contract
    
The main driver to decide which TTS to use is the quality for your target language and the number of voices supported.

## Extending support for new TTS engines

### Adding new code


It is possible to add support for new TTS engines by extending the class _TextToSpeech_. You have several examples to get you started.


### CLI
    
The CLI TTS, allows you to use any TTS that can be called from the command line.

You need to provide a configuration file (see [tss_cli_sample.json](./samples/tss_cli_sample.json)
and call it like this.

```shell
 open-dubbing --input_file video.mp4 --tts="cmd" --tts_cmd_cfg_file="your_tts_configuration.json"
```

The CLI approach works if your videos are very short but consider that it will be called to each segment and this  
is slow for long videos since you need to load the ML models for each fragment.

### API

The API allows

---

## Endpoints

### 1. List voices

- **URL:** `/voices`
- **Method:** `GET`

- **Response:**

  - **Code:** `200`
  - **Content:**

    ```json
        [
          {
            "gender": "male",
            "id": "2",
            "language": "cat",
            "name": "grau-central",
            "region": "central"
          },
          {
            "gender": "male",
            "id": "4",
            "language": "cat",
            "name": "pere-nord",
            "region": "nord"
          }
        ]
    ```

### 2. Syntetize a text using a voice

- **URL:** `/speak?{voice}&{text}`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **URL Parameters:** 
  * **id** - ID of the voice
  * **text** - Text to synthesize

- **Response:**

  - **Code:** `200 OK`
  - **Content:** - WAW audio file



# Translation

We currently support two translation engines:

* Meta's [No Language Left Behind](https://ai.meta.com/research/no-language-left-behind/)
* [Apertium](https://www.apertium.org/) open source translation API

It is possible to add support for new TTS engines by extending the class _Translation_
